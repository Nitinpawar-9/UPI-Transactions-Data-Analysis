# UPI-Transactions-Data-Analysis
In This Project where I analyzed UPI transactions using Power BI! 📊✨ This project involved several key steps that enhanced my data visualization skills and provided valuable insights. Here’s a breakdown of the process:

#🔄 Loading Data into Power BI Desktop
I started by importing UPI transaction data, ensuring a smooth transition from raw data to a structured format.

##🔍 Data Profiling
Conducted thorough data profiling to understand the dataset's characteristics, identifying any anomalies or trends.

##📏 Size & Position of Slicers
Adjusted the size and position of slicers for optimal user experience, making the dashboard intuitive and easy to navigate.

🎨 Formatting the Slicers
Enhanced the visual appeal by formatting the slicers, ensuring they align with the overall theme of the report.
➕ Adding a Page & Age Group Column
Created a new page dedicated to age group analysis, adding a column to categorize transactions by age demographics.
📈 Adding a Line Chart
Incorporated a line chart to visualize transaction trends over time, providing a clear picture of user behavior.
📊 Adding a Matrix Visual
Utilized a matrix visual to display detailed transaction data, allowing for easy comparison across different categories.
🔗 Syncing Slicers & Applying Conditional Formatting
Synced slicers across pages for a cohesive experience and applied conditional formatting to highlight key metrics.
📚 Adding Bookmarks for Transactions
Created bookmarks to allow users to quickly navigate between different transaction views, enhancing interactivity.
💰 Adding Bookmarks for Remaining Balance
Implemented bookmarks to track remaining balances, providing users with instant access to critical financial information.
☁️ Publishing the Report to Power BI Service
Finally, I published the report to Power BI Service, making it accessible for stakeholders to view and interact with the insights.
This project not only sharpened my analytical skills but also deepened my understanding of data visualization best practices. I’m looking forward to applying these skills in future projects! 🚀
